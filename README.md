# CTGP Deluxe version Homeassistant Sensor
The `ctgpdx` sensor will give you a sensor with the latest version available.

## Installation
### 1. Using HACS (recommended way)

This integration is no official HACS Integration and right now an custom integration.

Open HACS then install the "ctgpdx" integration or use the link below.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=FaserF&repository=ha-ctgpdx&category=integration)

If you use this method, your component will always update to the latest version.

### 2. Manual

- Download the latest zip release from [here](https://github.com/FaserF/ha-ctgpdx/releases/latest)
- Extract the zip file
- Copy the folder "ctgpdx" from within custom_components with all of its components to `<config>/custom_components/`

where `<config>` is your Home Assistant configuration directory.

>__NOTE__: Do not download the file by using the link above directly, the status in the "master" branch can be in development and therefore is maybe not working.

## Configuration

Go to Configuration -> Integrations and click on "add integration". Then search for "CTGP Deluxe Version".
